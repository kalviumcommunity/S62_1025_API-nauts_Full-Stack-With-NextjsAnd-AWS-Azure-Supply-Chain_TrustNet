# TrustNet – Lightweight Digital Identity Verification for Local Businesses

TrustNet empowers small-scale entrepreneurs and local businesses by giving them credible, verified digital identities. Traditional Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes are too document-heavy for micro-businesses, street vendors, and home-based entrepreneurs. TrustNet solves this by offering community validation, UPI transaction-based trust signals, and analytics that help local entrepreneurs build and showcase their credibility online.

## Reflection: Structural Design Rationale

The structure and technologies were chosen to maximize modularity, scalability, and performance across future sprints.

- Next.js 14 provides full-stack capabilities with built-in API routes, ensuring frontend and backend alignment.
- PostgreSQL with Prisma offers a robust ORM layer and easily maintainable schema evolution.
- Redis caching enhances performance for analytics and trust score computations.
- Docker ensures consistent development and production environments.

This structure supports collaborative scaling for future sprint pipelines where each subsystem (analytics, verification, dashboard) can evolve independently with minimal coupling.

## Code Quality Configuration

### TypeScript

We enabled strict mode to catch potential issues early:

- `"strict": true` ensures all types are defined.
- `"noImplicitAny": true` prevents untyped variables.
- `"noUnusedLocals"` and `"noUnusedParameters"` clean up unused code.

### ESLint + Prettier

Our ESLint configuration extends `next/core-web-vitals` and Prettier rules to ensure clean, readable, and consistent code.
We enforce:

- No console logs in production.
- Mandatory semicolons.
- Double quotes for all strings.

### Husky + lint-staged

We use Husky and lint-staged to automatically lint and format code before commits.  
This ensures that no badly formatted code enters our repository.

### Example Output

When committing code that violates lint rules, Husky blocks the commit until all issues are fixed.

# Environment Variables Configuration for TrustNet Backend

This document explains the environment variables needed for the TrustNet backend, their purposes, client vs server safety, how to replicate the setup using `.env.example`, and common pitfalls avoided.

---

## Purpose of Each Environment Variable

| Variable          | Purpose                                                                         | Client-Side Safe?              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `DATABASE_URL`    | Connection string for the PostgreSQL database                                   | No (Server-side only)          |
| `JWT_SECRET`      | Secret key for signing JSON Web Tokens for user authentication                  | No (Server-side only)          |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Secret used for NextAuth session encryption                                     | No (Server-side only)          |
| `REDIS_URL`       | Connection URL for Redis server used for caching and session storage            | No (Server-side only)          |
| `NODE_ENV`        | Defines environment mode (e.g., development, production)                        | No (Server-side only)          |
| `UPI_SERVICE_URL` | URL for UPI verification service (mock during dev, real endpoint in production) | No (Server-side only)          |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL`    | Public URL of the application, used by NextAuth for redirect callbacks          | Yes (safe to expose if needed) |

---

## Server-Side vs Client-Side Access

- All environment variables except `NEXTAUTH_URL` are **server-side only** and must not be exposed in client-side bundles.
- Ensure no sensitive variables have the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix, as Next.js exposes those to the browser.
- Variables without `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix are accessible only in API routes and server code via `process.env`.
- This separation protects secrets like database URLs, JWT secrets, and Redis connections from client exposure.

---

## How to Replicate the Setup Using `.env.example`

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in your project root.
2. Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials and secrets:
   - Update PostgreSQL connection string (`DATABASE_URL`)
   - Generate strong secrets for `JWT_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
   - Configure correct Redis connection URL (`REDIS_URL`)
   - Point `UPI_SERVICE_URL` to the appropriate service endpoint
   - Set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to your deployed application URL
3. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing sensitive secrets to version control.
4. Restart your development or production server after modifying `.env` to ensure all variables load correctly.
5. For deployment, use your cloud provider's environment variable configuration (AWS, Azure, Docker secrets, etc.) instead of local `.env`.

---

## Common Pitfalls Avoided

- **Exposing secrets accidentally**: No sensitive variables are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, avoiding client bundle exposure.
- **Not committing secrets**: The `.env.example` serves as a safe template only; the actual `.env` file is excluded from version control.
- **Quotation usage**: Values with special characters or URLs are wrapped in double quotes to avoid parsing errors.
- **Runtime accessibility**: Variables are accessed at runtime in server-side API routes, preventing build-time leakage.
- **Clear naming and documentation**: Variable names and comments make purpose and usage explicit, preventing misconfiguration.

---

This approach ensures secure and smooth configuration of environment variables for the TrustNet backend while easing setup for other developers.

🔧 Environment-Aware Build Setup

We created .env.development, .env.staging, and .env.production for each environment.
Secrets are securely stored using GitHub Secrets and injected via CI/CD pipelines.

Build scripts:

npm run build:dev → Local testing

npm run build:staging → Staging deployment

npm run build:production → Production deployment

Why this matters:
This setup ensures consistent deployments and protects sensitive credentials across environments.
No real secrets are ever committed to GitHub.

# Prisma Database Migrations and Seed Scripts

## Overview

This guide explains how to use Prisma ORM for database migrations and seed scripts to ensure all environments have a consistent database schema and initial data. It covers setup, migration management, seeding scripts, verifying data, and rollback safety.

## Setup

1. Ensure that **Prisma** and **PostgreSQL** are configured in your project.
2. Initialize Prisma:
      
   - npx prisma init

## Database Migrations

### Create and Apply First Migration

Generate migration files, apply them to the database, and update the Prisma Client:

   - npx prisma migrate dev --name init_schema

### Modify or Add a New Migration

To modify the schema or add a new table:

   - npx prisma migrate dev --name add_project_table


### Reset or Rollback Database

Reset the database, re-apply all migrations, and optionally re-run the seed script:

   - npx prisma migrate reset


## Seed Script

1. Create the file `prisma/seed.ts`:

import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function main() {
await prisma.user.createMany({
data: [
{ name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' },
{ name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@example.com' },
],
});
console.log('Seed data inserted successfully');
}

main()
.then(async () => await prisma.$disconnect())
.catch(async (e) => {
console.error(e);
await prisma.$disconnect();
process.exit(1);
});


2. Add the seed command to your `package.json`:

"prisma": {
"seed": "ts-node prisma/seed.ts"
}


3. Run the seed script:

   - npx prisma db seed


## Verify the Data

Use Prisma Studio to check that the seed data has been inserted:

   - npx prisma studio


## Rollback and Safety

- Always test all migrations locally before applying to production.
- Use backups and staging environments for safety.
- Treat migrations as version-controlled code; do not edit existing migrations after they’ve been applied in production.

## Sample output logs

## Database Schema

Our PostgreSQL schema enables core features:

**User Management**: Phone-based authentication with roles (Customer/Business Owner/Admin)

**Business** Profiles: Complete business info with trust scoring and multiple verification methods (phone, community, UPI)

**Trust System**: Reviews (1-5 stars), endorsements from community, and calculated trust scores

**UPI Integration**: Transaction pattern analysis without storing personal financial data

**Analytics**: Pre-computed metrics for fast dashboard performance

### Key Features

Privacy-first: Only aggregated UPI insights, no personal transaction data

Scalable design: CUID identifiers, proper indexing, cascade deletes

Multiple verification: Progressive trust building through different methods

Performance optimized: Indexed fields, efficient relationships

Quick Start

1. npm run db:generate # Generate Prisma client
2. npm run db:push # Update database schema
3. npm run db:seed # Add sample data
4. npm run db:studio # Database GUI
5. The schema supports TrustNet's mission of building digital credibility for local businesses through community-powered verification.
